Hello Cloud Gurus

Pulling in changes.

 In the example above, the two shell script files git-diff and git-merge are provided in the DeltaWalker default installation folder e.g. C:/Program Files/Deltopia/DeltaWalker 2.0/ . If DeltaWalker is installed elsewhere you need to update its path in .gitconfig .

The shell scripts git-diff and git-merge are the same as the ones used for Mac OS X and Linux (above).

Once done merging, you need to save the contents of the Reference panel using the Save menu, button, or shortcut so that DeltaWalker can save it to the file specified by the -merged parameter.
